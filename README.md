# Wearable-device-to-measure-heart-rate-variability-

This project was a part of my internship done at CEERI Chennai. There were two tasks in that project. The first task was to interface a PPG sensor with an IoT module called Nanopi
Neo Air using an ADC module called ADS1115 with I2C protocol. The PPG signals were stored in a local memory.

The second task of the project was to apply various signal processing algorithms on the stored data to obtain the necessary information in calculating the heart rate variability 
measures. DSP algorithms like cubic spline interpolation, moving average filter and bandpass butterworth filter were applied on the data to quantify the useful information and 
then average heart rate and instantaneous heart rate were calculated.
